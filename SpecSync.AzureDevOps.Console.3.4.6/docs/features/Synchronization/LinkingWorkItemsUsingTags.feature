Feature: Linking Work Items and other artifacts using tags

Synchronizing special work-item tags (e.g. @story:123) to work item links in test cases

Rule: Establish work item links based on scenario tags

@tc:155
Scenario: A work item link tag added to the scenario
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project with a Bug
	And the synchronizer is configured as
		| setting                           | value |
		| synchronization/links[]/tagPrefix | bug   |
	And a @bug tag has been added to an existing synchronized scenario as:
		"""
		@tc:[id-of-test-case] @bug:[id-of-bug]
		Scenario: Sample scenario
			When I do something
		"""
	When the local workspace is synchronized with push
	Then the Test Case should be linked to the Bug

@tc:156
Scenario: A work item link tag added to the feature
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project with a Product Backlog Item
	And there is a feature file in the local workspace that was already synchronized before
		"""
