@tc:518 @bypass-ado-integration
Scenario: Multiple attachments with the same file name causes synchronization errors
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured as
		| setting                             | value |
		| synchronization/attachments/enabled | true  |

@tc:519 @bypass-ado-integration
Scenario: Non-existing attached file causes synchronization errors

	When the local workspace is synchronized with push
	Then the Test Case should contain the following attachment:

		| file 1.txt |

Rule: The base folder of the attached files can be specified and uses the folder of the feature file by default

@tc:521 @bypass-ado-integration
Scenario: Attachment base folder is configured to a folder relative to the config file
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And there is a file files/attachements/file_in_folder.txt in the local repository

Rule: Attachments are removed from the Test Case if the attachment tag is removed from the scenario

@tc:522
Scenario: Attachment tag is removed if it was synchronized by SpecSync
	The attachments that were added in Azure DevOps manually should remain
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project

Rule: Wildcards can be used in attachment tags to attach multiple files

@tc:523 @bypass-ado-integration
Scenario: Multiple files from the same folder are attached with a wildcard
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured as

		| name      |
		| file1.txt |
		| file2.txt |

Rule: Updates of the attached files are tracked

@tc:526
Scenario: File change is detected
	The file change is detected even if the scenario was not changed otherwise.
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured as
		| setting                             | value |

	When the local workspace is synchronized with push
	Then the Test Case should contain the following attachments:

Rule: Limitation: Files can only be attached to a Test Case, not a Test Case step
