Rule: Enabling link-on-change customization does not make scenarios dirty

This rule ensures that you can use multiple configuration files, one with and one without 
a link-on-change config, but switching between the config files does not cause uneccessary 
updates. 
(E.g., for pull request builds, a special config can be used with the linking feature on.)
