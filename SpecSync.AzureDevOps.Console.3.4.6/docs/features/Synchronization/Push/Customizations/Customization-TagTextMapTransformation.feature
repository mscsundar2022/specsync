Feature: Tag Text Map Transformation

Provides ability to replace substrings inside tags, e.g.
* "__" => " "
* "=" => "-"

Rule: Should transform tags on push

@tc:240
Scenario: A scenario with a tag containing mapped characters is linked
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured to use tag text map transformation as
		| local | remote |
		| __    | .      |
		| =     | -      |
	And there is a feature file in the local repository
		"""
		Feature: Sample feature

		@my__tag=value
		Scenario: Sample scenario
			When I do something
		"""
	When the local repository is synchronized with push
	Then a new test case work item "Scenario: Sample scenario" is created in the project
	And the new Test Case should have the following tags: "my.tag-value"

Scenario: Remote tag contains whitespace
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured to use tag text map transformation as

		| __    | " "    |
	And there is a feature file in the local repository

	When the local repository is synchronized with push

	And the new Test Case should have the following tags: "my tag"

Rule: Should detect scenario as unchanged with transformed tags

@tc:241
Scenario: Scenario with a transformed tag was not changed
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured to use tag text map transformation as

	And the feature file has been synchronized already
	When the local workspace is synchronized with push
	Then the Test Case should not be changed

Rule: Reverse transformation is performed on pull

Scenario: A transformed tag is added to the test case
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
