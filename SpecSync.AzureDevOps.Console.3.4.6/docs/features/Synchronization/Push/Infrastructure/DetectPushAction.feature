Feature: Detect Push Action

When SpecSync pushes changes to the test case, in addtion to updating the test 
case fields, it also saves the hash of the local state of the scenario. This is 
the scenario-sync-hash. The scenario-sync-hash includes the hash of the core 
scenario details, like name, steps, examples, tags (test-case-hash), and the 
hash of the applied formatting and the custom field update values.

When deciding about whether to update a test case or not, the following values 
are used:
- if it was updated by SpecSync last
- the scenario-sync-hash of the last SpecSync update
- the scenario-sync-hash of the local version
- the test-case-hash of the remote state parsed back from the test case fields

Based on that currently the following cases are detected:
- No change neither locally nor remotely => up-to-date
  - (The test case was last updated by SpecSync and the local 
    scenario-sync-hash is the same)
- A local change was pushed, but it has been reverted, forgotten to check-in or 
  not checked-in yet => outdated with warning
  - (The test case was last updated by SpecSync and the local 
    scenario-sync-hash is the same as the hash of the one before last SpecSync 
	update on remote)
- The scenario was changed locally but not remotely => outdated
  - (The test case was last updated by SpecSync and the local 
    scenario-sync-hash is different)
- The format configuration has been changed => outdated
  - (The test case was last updated by SpecSync and the local 
    scenario-sync-hash is different)
- The test case has been changed remotely, but the changes did not affect the 
  core scenario details => outdated (but won't override anything)
  - (The test case was last updated by the user and the remote test-case-hash 
    is the same as the test-case-hash of the last SpecSync update)
- Both sides has been changed => outdated with warning (SpecSync will override 
  remote change)
  - (The test case was last updated by the user and the remote test-case-hash 
    is different from the test-case-hash of the last SpecSync update.)

Rule: Should detect scenario up-to-date when there is no change neither locally nor remotely

@tc:267
Scenario: Usual scenario was not changed
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And there is a usual scenario that was already synchronized before
	When the local workspace is synchronized with push
	Then the Test Case should not be changed

@tc:268 @customization
Scenario: Scenario with custom field updates was not changed
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured to use custom field updates as
		| field identifier    | value                               |
		| [description-field] | Description: {scenario-description} |
	And there is a usual scenario that was already synchronized before
	When the local workspace is synchronized with push
	Then the Test Case should not be changed

@tc:269
Scenario: A not-synchronized field of the Test Case were changed
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And there is a usual scenario that was already synchronized before
	When the Test Case description is updated to "Changed description"
	And the local repository is synchronized with push
	Then the Test Case should not be changed
	And the log should not contain "POTENTIAL CONFLICT"

Rule: Should detect Test Case changes and override them

@tc:938
Scenario: A synchronized field of the Test Case were changed
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And there is a usual scenario that was already synchronized before
	When the Test Case title is updated to "title modified by user"
	And the local repository is synchronized with push
	Then the scenario should have been synchronized by updating remote Test Case
	And the log should contain "POTENTIAL CONFLICT"
	And the Test Case revision should contain SpecSync source version


Rule: Should detect scenario outdated when format configuration has been changed

@tc:270
@notsupported-JIRA.DataCenter.ZephyrScale
Scenario: Use expected result format configuration has been changed
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured as
		| setting                                  | value |
		| synchronization/format/useExpectedResult | true  |
	And there is a usual scenario that was already synchronized before
	And the synchronizer is configured as
		| setting                                  | value |
		| synchronization/format/useExpectedResult | false |
	When the local workspace is synchronized with push
	Then the scenario should have been synchronized by updating remote Test Case

Rule: Should treat Test Cases synchronized with V2 hash up-to-date when V3 hash enabled

@tc:271 
@notsupported-JIRA.DataCenter.ZephyrScale
Scenario: V2 hash is introduced in an existing setup
	Given there is an Azure DevOps project
	And the synchronizer is configured to use V2 hash
	And there is a usual scenario that was already synchronized before
	And the synchronizer is configured to use V3 hash
	When the local workspace is synchronized with push
	Then the Test Case should not be changed
