Feature: Force Update

There are different force levels (level 2 is the default):
- 1: force push changes unless the parsed back server version is the same as the local
- 2: force push changes unless all fields are updated to the same
- 3: force push changes in any case

Background: 
	Given there is a VSTS project
	And the synchronizer is configured to force updates
	And the synchronizer is configured to set force update level to 2

Rule: Force update (level 2) should not update unchanged test case
- simple scenarios
- scenarios with data tables
- scenarios with data tables (plain text mode)
- scenarios with doc strings
- scenarios with then steps (use expected result)
- scenarios with background steps (prefixed)
- scenarios with background steps (non-prefixed)
- scenario outlines (examples colum in usage order)
- scenario outlines (examples colum not in usage order)
- scenario outlines (unused examples column)
- scenarios with tags
- scenarios with links
- scenarios with custom field updates
